I am a technology architect with over twenty years of experience designing and stabilizing enterprise platforms in banking and hybrid environments. My background spans infrastructure, cloud, virtualization, middleware, and distributed systems, with a strong focus on resilience and operational clarity. I am naturally introverted, but I thrive on meaningful challenges and enjoy solving complex problems as part of a strong, collaborative team. Turning lessons from incidents into lasting improvements is something I take pride in.

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects, exploring photography, cycling with my boys, and spending quiet time reading books. I value continuous learning, thoughtful design, and building systems and experiences that are practical and dependable.
